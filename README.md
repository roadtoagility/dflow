## About Project
DFlow was born as a reference implementation of Domain-Drive Design architecture based with aggregates supporting Event Sourcing design pattern but evolves to a full flagged platform to helps you to implement your own framework based on DFlow Domain-Driven concepts supported by Domain-Driven Design tools.

Do you have a lot of flexibility to evolve your applications. Each platform library enforce just few concepts used by each specific layer, do you pay for what you use but you can implement your view of DFlow interfaces and evolve as your desire.

As an example, we provide contrib packages like **Dflow.Persistence.EntityFramework** that enables you to use ORM based approach to your persistence layer using EntityFramework with any database driver that you want and DFlow.EventBus.FluentMediator that is a interface to used the excellent framework FluentMediator.

## Documentation
For now we implement few example projects that you can look at in [samples](https://github.com/roadtoagility/dflow/tree/master/samples) folder

Sample|Description|Link|
-|-|-|
SimplestApp| It is a basicv application using **DFlow.Domain** library|[SimplestApp](https://github.com/roadtoagility/dflow/tree/master/samples/SimplestApp)|
SimplestApp.Business.Cqrs| It is a basic implementation of CQRS-base application using **DFlow.Business.Cqrs** library |[SimplestApp.Business.Cqrs](https://github.com/roadtoagility/dflow/tree/master/samples/SimplestApp.Business.Cqrs)|
SimplestApp.Persistence.EntityFramework|It is a basic application using all libraries of DFlow platform for CQRS + DDD + ORM|[SimplestApp.Persistence.EntityFramework](https://github.com/roadtoagility/dflow/tree/master/samples/SimplestApp.Persistence.EntityFramework)|

## Roadmap
  * Finish support to Event Sourcing in Persistence Layer
  * Test a 100% of code
  * Finish the performance tests support
  * Improve documentation
  * much more...
